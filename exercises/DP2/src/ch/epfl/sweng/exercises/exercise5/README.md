Assume you are operating a coffee shop that offers the following beverages: 
`HouseBlend`, `DarkRoast`, etc. 
For tracking the beverages, you created an `abstract class Beverage`
that is extended by specific beverage classes. Furthermore, each beverage
includes a `description` and a `cost` as seen in the figure below.

You decided to add different condiments in your coffees, 
such as steamed milk, whipped milk, soy, etc. 
You could introduce these condiments in your code by introducing classes such as
 `DarkRoastWithSteamedMilk`, `DecafWithWhippedMilk`, etc. 
 Among others, such an approach is not satisfactory, since it would bloat our codebase with extra classes.

Therefore, we are going to use the **decorator pattern**. Fill up the remaining code or create more classes if needed
so you pass from the `CafeShopTest` class.

Use the following prices:

Try to understand what happens when we calculate some cost, 
e.g., `new WhippedMilk(new Soy(new Steamed Milk(new DarkRoast()))).cost()`.
