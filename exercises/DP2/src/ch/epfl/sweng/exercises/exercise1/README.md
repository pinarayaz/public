You have been using `FacebookPoster` in your application to post and get messages from Facebook. 
Specifically, your code is full with calls to the `postMessage` and `getMessage` methods from the `FacebookPoster` class. 
Unfortunately, Facebook decided to change its provided API and now you have to use `NewFacebookPoster`. 
Instead of modifying everything, you decide to use the **adapter design pattern**.

Create a new class with the name `NewFacebokPosterToFacebookPosterAdapter` and instantiate it in the `PosterTest` class, 
so you pass the test.
