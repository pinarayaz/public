## Exercise 4

You have an implementation of a binary search tree (`BinarySearchTree`) with integers. 
Write code such that `BinarySearchTree` implements `Iterable` and the provided iterator iterates through the elements
in ["pre-order traversal."](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)
