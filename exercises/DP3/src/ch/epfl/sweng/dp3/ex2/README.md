## Exercise 2

Say you have directories (`Directory` class) that can only contain files (`File` class).

You want to sort (in ascending order) the files in a directory based on their `name` or their `size`.

Use the **strategy pattern** to easily introduce different sorting techniques.
Introduce code as needed to pass the `DirectoryTest` test.
