The theory part is worth 20 points out of a total of 100 for the exam.
There are a total of 20 questions in this part of the exam, each worth 1 point.

Unless noted, each question has a single correct answer.

The practice part is a series of programming exercises,
and is worth 80 points of the 100 points on the exam. Please plan your time accordingly.

**Please fill in the theory part by marking an 'x' in the appropriate boxes
below (``[x]``).**

### Question 1

What is usually true of code implemented using design patterns?
(multiple answers may be possible)

- [ ] It does not require code review.
- [ ] It runs faster.
- [x] It is easier to understand and maintain.


### Question 2

You’re designing a data model for a `SwEngClass`, consisting of `Student`s and `Instructor`s,
both of which are `Human`s. What is the correct relation among these entities?

- [x] `Student` and `Instructor` inherits from `Human`, `SwEngClass` contains `Student`s and `Instructor`s.
- [ ] `Instructor` inherits from `Human`, `Student` inherits from `Instructor`, `SwEngClass` contains `Student`s and `Instructor`s.
- [ ] `Human` inherits from `Instructor`, `Student` inherits from `Instructor`, `SwEngClass` contains `Student`s and `Instructor`s.
- [ ] `Student` and `Instructor` inherit from `SwEngClass`.


### Question 3

Can a `List<Giraffe>` be passed as an argument to a method that requires a
`List<Animal>` (where `Giraffe` inherits from `Animal`)?

- [ ] No, because `List<Giraffe>` and `List<Animal>` do not have the same internal representation.
- [ ] No, because its `get` method returns a `Giraffe` and not an `Animal`.
- [ ] No, because its `add` method takes in a `Giraffe` and not an `Animal`.
- [x] Yes, because `Giraffe`s are `Animal`s.


### Question 4

Which of the following statements is **not** true of the Singleton design pattern?

- [ ] It ensures that only one instance of an object is created.
- [ ] It prevents errors in concurrent and parallel programs.
- [x] It has similar uses to global variables.


### Question 5

It does not matter if a method checks at the beginning for a `null` argument and throws
an exception, if a statement later in the method body dereferences the argument
and throws a `NullPointerException`.

- [x] Yes, this is always true and good practice because it make the code shorter and easier to read.
- [ ] Yes, this is always true, but it is still helpful to document the invariant by adding the explicit test.
- [ ] No, sometimes it matters.
- [ ] No, it always matters whether a null test is made explicitly.


### Question 6

Assume you have implemented three classes, `Integer`, `Rational`, and `Real`,
corresponding to numeric quantities. What is the proper inheritance relationship
among these clases?

- [x] `Integer` implements `Rational`, which implements `Real`.
- [ ] `Real` implements `Rational`, which implements `Integer`.
- [ ] They should not inherit from each other because of the Liskov Substitution Principle.
- [ ] They should not inherit from each other because `Real` numbers are approximate.


### Question 7

Which preconditions or postconditions violate rules about inheritance? (multiple answers may be possible)

```java
public class Shape {
    @Requires("xScale > 0") // #1
    @Requires("yScale > 0") // #2
    @Ensures("after.area().equals(before.area() * xScale * yScale)") // #3
    void enlarge(double xScale, double yScale);
}

public class Square extends Shape {
    @Requires("xScale > 0") // #4
    @Requires("xScale == yScale") // #5
    @Ensures("true") // #6
    void enlarge(real xScale, real yScale);
}
```

- [ ] #1
- [ ] #2
- [ ] #3
- [x] #4
- [ ] #5
- [x] #6


### Question 8

Which of the following statements about testing are correct? (multiple answers may be possible)

- [x] Carefully designed and implemented code is easier to test.
- [ ] Program verification is always better at finding bugs than testing.
- [ ] Random testing is the last, desperate act of incompetent programmers.
- [ ] Code with 100% test coverage is correct.


### Question 9

Consider the following code that tests whether a number is prime:

```java
boolean isPrime(int n) {
  if (n < 2) return false;
  boolean result = true;
  for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      result = false;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

Consider the following optimizations:

1. Store the result of `Math.sqrt(n)` in a variable
2. Replace the loop condition by `i * i <= n`
3. Change the loop so that it tests only 2 and odd numbers
4. Replace `result = false` with `return false`

Which of these statements are true? (multiple answers may be possible)

- [x] All of these optimizations are valid.
- [ ] Some of these optimizations are invalid (e.g., they change the result of
  the program).
- [x] All of these optimizations give at most a constant speedup.
- [ ] Compilers can perform these optimizations automatically.
- [ ] One of these optimizations is a form of loop unrolling.
- [x] One of these optimizations is a form of precomputation.


### Question 10

Imagine an Android app like Google Maps that enables you to find driving directions between two locations and displays the result on a map.
Which parts of the app implement the MVC pattern elements: model, view, controller, respectively?

- [x] Network provider, widgets, activities.
- [ ] Activities, network provider, widgets.
- [ ] Widgets, activities, network provider.
- [ ] Activities, widgets, activities.


### Question 11

Which of the following questions about security are correct? (multiple answers may be possible)

- [x] Testing is effective in finding security flaws.
- [ ] No software is secure.
- [x] The Liskov substitution principle can prevent intentional misuse of components.

When should you do non-trivial refactoring of your code?

- [x] Continuously: do it whenever you have a few minutes to spare.
- [ ] Before you start testing it.
- [ ] When the declining quality of the code impedes further development.
- [ ] Whenever the code changes and the number of bugs increases.


### Question 14

What is true about static program analysis? (multiple answers may be possible)

- [ ] A bug report that is not a real bug is called a *false positive.*
- [x] Developers can focus on the most important issues by filtering static analysis reports by age, severity, etc.
- [ ] An IOException that occurs at runtime is a form of static analysis output.
- [x] Android Lint is an example of a static analysis tool.

- [ ] Composite


### Question 16

Which of the following are good reasons to use design patterns that separate programming logic and user interaction such as MVC? (multiple answers may be possible)

- [ ] It results in less code overall.
- [x] The code becomes easier to understand and maintain.
- [x] It becomes easier to port the application to a different platform.
- [x] Testing is easier.
- [ ] Most platforms, including Android, are already based on MVC-like patterns.


### Question 17

What is meant by *defensive programming*?

- [ ] Achieving 100% test coverage.
- [x] Checking inputs to a program to ensure they are valid.
- [ ] Developing code on Mac OS rather than Windows.
- [ ] It's a term defined in the Department of Defense's "SCG-1 Secure Coding

- [ ] Never pushing to the master branch, and using pull requests instead.
- [x] Using a system such as Jenkins to detect errors early.


### Question 18

Which of the following should be in code comments?

- [x] *What* the code is doing.
- [ ] *When* the code was written.

```java
DeathStar star = getDeathStar();
if (star.hasNotBeenBlownUp()) {
    star.shootAt(Planets.ALDERAAN);
}
```

- [x] The Product Owner
- [ ] The Scrum Master
- [ ] The Development Team
