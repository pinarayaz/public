## Midterm Exam

This midterm exam comes from the `exams-GASPAR` repo of your `student-GASPAR` team in the `sweng-epfl` GitHub organization.
You have already been asked to clone this repo in advance of the exam in order to test that everything works well using a mock exam. Make sure to `git pull` this repo when the exam is released. Push your answers to the `master` branch on this repo.


Grading will be done on a snapshot of the `master` branch of this repository from GitHub, not your machine. The snapshot will be taken at **12:15 on 09-Nov-2018**, and access to this repo will be terminated at that point (or earlier, if you leave the exam room). Please be careful not to overwrite your work, as we will not roll back your commits. Commit and push your work often during the exam, to make sure you don't lose local changes and to mitigate the risk of GitHub going down shortly before the end of the exam. We use automated scripts to extract the answers from your repo, so follow the instructions exactly, and do not place stray characters in the files you push.

We strongly advise that you read each problem statement at least twice. You need to provide a correct answer to the _correct_ question in order to receive full credit. A correct answer to a _wrong or misinterpreted_ question will not earn credit. If you have any doubts, ask the SwEng staff.

Exam rules:

- Use your laptop to do the work.
- You are not permitted to wear headphones during the exam.
- The exam is open-book, so you can consult any resource during the exam (website, class material, StackOverflow, etc.) but you are not permitted to copy code from any such resource, and the resource must have been created prior to the start of the exam.
- You may use code that you or your team wrote for this class prior to the start of the exam, or code from the lectures.
- You are not permitted to interact with or receive any assistance from any human being during the exam other than the course staff.  Any use of Facebook, Email, Hangouts, IRC, phone, SMS, Skype, TeamViewer, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. will be automatically deemed to be cheating and will be treated accordingly. We will be monitoring network traffic in and out of the exam rooms, so please make sure that any background email agents and equivalent that you may have on your laptop are stopped.
- Please note in the exam solution what external resources you used (e.g., URLs). Using external resources without noting them in the exam constitutes cheating.
- If you wish to leave early, you must show your CAMIPRO card to one of the course staff and await their confirmation that you can indeed depart; we will turn off access to your exam repo at that time.
- If you leave early without showing your CAMIPRO card to one of the staff, you will not receive any points for the exam.
- Toward the end of the exam, the staff may ask you to remain seated, in order to avoid disturbing students who want to work until the end of the exam timeslot.
- If you need to use the bathroom during the exam, you must be escorted by a member of the staff. Leaving the room without an escort will be treated as an early departure: your repo will be locked, and you will not be permitted re-entry into the exam room.

The midterm exam is worth 100 points in total, and you have 180 minutes (3 hours) to complete it. The exam consists of two parts:

**Part 1: Theory [40 points]**
